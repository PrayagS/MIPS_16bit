# 16-bit MIPS (Microprocessor Without Interlocked Pipleline Stages)
This repository is Verilog description of a 16 bit MIPS processor. There are eight main blocks:
- Execution Block
- Program Memory Block
- Register Bank Block
- Data Memory Block
- Writeback Block
- Jump Control Block
- Stall Control Block
- Dependency Check Block

The repository contains test bench for every block, as well as for main modules (debug_1.v and debug_2.v).

## Floating-point operations (Work in progress)
floating_point.v contains code for performing floating point addition. Numbers are represented using IEEE-754 standard. The code works so far only for addition of positive numbers.

## Cache: Direct mapping scheme
We use the following scheme:

## Regarding memory blocks
The project was made in Xilinx ISE 14.7. 'Program Memory' and 'Data Memory' blocks use modules called 'PMem' and 'DMem' respectively which were essentially Xilinx memory blocks generated using IPCore.
